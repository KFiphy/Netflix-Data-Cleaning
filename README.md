# Netflix-Dataset-Exploration

In this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project, our focus is on delving into the Netflix dataset to gain valuable insights and understand the patterns and trends within the vast array of available data. The dataset contains information about the streaming platform's content, user interactions, or other relevant metrics. In the data analysis process, the primary goal was to summarize the main characteristics of the dataset by answering some predefined questions.
